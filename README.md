# Reaching Task

This repository is based on [Assistive Gym](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym) which is a physics-based simulation framework for physical human-robot interaction and robotic assistance. 

This code accompanies the submission:\
"A Multi-Agent Simulation Environment for Human-Robot Collaboration in an Industrial Setting"\
Gabriele Ansaldo


The repository contains two main folders. One contains the files created for **designing** the simulation environment and the other contains the files related to **transfering** a learned policy onto a real [Sawyer Robot](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer) with the help of a [ZED 2](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed-2/) camera.

### Desing of Environment (Folder 1)
For the design of the environment [Assistive Gym](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym) was utilized. For details on how to install Assistive Gym please check out the [installation guide for Assistive Gym](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym/wiki/1.-Install).\
Once installed please replace the fo
